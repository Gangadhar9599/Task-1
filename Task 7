-- Step 1: Create the sample table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT,
    name TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    salary INT
);

-- Step 2: Insert sample data
INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 'IT', 80000),
(2, 'Bob', 'HR', 60000),
(3, 'Charlie', 'IT', 75000),
(4, 'Diana', 'Finance', 90000),
(5, 'Eve', 'HR', 62000);

-- Step 3: Create View 1 - Employees with salary > 70000
CREATE VIEW high_salary_employees AS
SELECT emp_id, name, department, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 70000;

-- Step 4: Create View 2 - Average salary by department
CREATE VIEW avg_salary_by_department AS
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

-- Step 5: Create View 3 - Public view without salary (for abstraction/security)
CREATE VIEW employee_public_view AS
SELECT emp_id, name, department
FROM employees;

-- Step 6: Test the views
SELECT * FROM high_salary_employees;
SELECT * FROM avg_salary_by_department;
SELECT * FROM employee_public_view;
